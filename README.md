# competitive-programming-environment

Repository that contains configuration files and steps to setup my CP environment.  This mostly for setting up on new machines, but I guess it doesn't hurt for this to be public either.

The instructions assume you're using Ubuntu on WSL with Windows Terminal as the terminal.

This repository will be updated somewhat regularly.
