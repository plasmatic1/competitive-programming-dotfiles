# competitive-programming-environment

Repository that contains configuration files and steps to setup my current CP environment.  There is both a `setup_plan.md` for instructions along with a `setup.sh` script that will setup 

The markdown instructions assume you're using Ubuntu on WSL with Windows Terminal as the terminal (though running it on pure Linux is perfectly fine), while setup script is intended for a pure Linux machine (but can also be run within WSL).  The setup script has been tested on a fresh VM running Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS.

There are also some differences in specifics between the `setup_plan.md` document and the `setup.sh` script, and those are described in `setup_plan.md`.

This repository is updated fairly regularly.
